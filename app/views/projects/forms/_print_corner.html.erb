          <li>US Authors Only- Paperback copies can be ordered by the author directly from the book’s CreateSpace e-store. Authors will be provided with a link to their book's unique e-store and a coupon code to use until May 31, 2016. This coupon code will enable authors to receive a 55% discount on each order (plus shipping and any applicable tax). The creative team (including the author) will receive royalties on these orders.</li>
          <li>Creative Team Member Copies, US Only – Creative team members will also have access to the book’s CreateSpace e-store and coupon code and can purchase books at a 55% discount until May 31, 2016.</li>
