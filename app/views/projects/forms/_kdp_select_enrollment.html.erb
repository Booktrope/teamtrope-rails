          <p>To enroll your title in KDP Select please fill out the necessary information on the next page, and DO NOT
            resubmit multiple forms. Once this form has been submitted it'll be final for the 90-day period from the
            Enrollment Start date provided. </p>

          <p>When you enroll into KDP Select, the book will also be included in Kindle Unlimited and the Kindle Owners'
            Lending Library (KOLL). There are also some commonly listed FAQ questions
            <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A6KILDRNSCOBA">here</a>.</p>

          <p>You can participate in either the <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A2MJTCAYTCBNW2">Kindle Countdown
            Deals</a> or <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A34IQ0W14ZKXM9">Free Book Promotions</a> during your
            90-day period.  Please select your dates and choice of promotion in the KDP Update form.</p>

          <p>Books will be enrolled on the 1st and 15th of each month. Please read Katherine's teamtrope post for more
            details <a href="https://teamtrope.com/2014/12/kdp-select-update/">click here</a>. If your title is available on
            Wattpad it is your responsibility to have it removed from that channel before the Enrollment Start Date.</p>

          <p>NOTE: If your book is available as part of a collection, you must also enroll that collection in KDP Select and
            if you enroll a collection, all other books in that collection must also be enrolled.</p>

          <p>Your title will be re-enrolled following the 90-day period - until you request it be ceased using the KDP
            Update form.</p>
